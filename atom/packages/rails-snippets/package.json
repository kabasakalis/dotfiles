  "readme": "# rails-snippets package\nAn [atom](https://atom.io) package to add snippets for Ruby on Rails projects.\n\nDeveloped with Ruby 1.9 syntax (`key: 'value'`) and rails 4 onwards in mind, but most code in the snippets is going to work on Rails 3 too.\n\nContributions are greatly appreciated, if your favorite snippets are missing [open an issue](https://github.com/joseramonc/railsteroids/issues) or send a pull request, I would :heart: to merge your favorite snippets.\n\nPlease fork this repository and open a pull request to add / improve snippets.\n\n## Features\n* Snippets with nice defaults that are definitely going to save your a lot of time.\n\n* [Toggle between erb blocks](https://github.com/eddorre/SublimeERB):\n\n  ![demo](http://cl.ly/image/1P2E1x0h210l/toggle_erb.gif)\n\nToggle with:  <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>></kbd>\n\n(In american keyboard: <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd>)\n\n#### Customize ERB Blocks (extra configuration)\nIn your atom configuration file. Insert each erb block you'd like as an array with the first element as the opening erb and the 2nd element as the closing erb into rails-snippets's erbBlocks configuration array.\n\nAs an example of how'd look like:\n```\n# config.cson\n\"*\":\n  # all your configs...\n  \"rails-snippets\":\n      erbBlocks: [\n        ['<%=', '%>']\n        ['<%', '%>']\n        ['<%#', '%>']\n      ]\n```\nIf you can stick to the default (above) you don't have to do anything. Otherwise add or remove erb blocks in the order you'd like.\n\n## Conventions\nThe conventions for the snippets are usually the initials for the method.\n\nExamples:\n* For `validates_presence_of` is `vpo`\n* For `has_and_belongs_to_many` is `habtm`\n* For `<%= link_to 'hi', path %>` is `lt` and so on.\n\nAlso if the method has an optional block like `content_tag` (snippet is `ct`), its block it's going to be adding `block` to the shortcut, in this case `ctblock`\n\n## Snippets list\n\nHere are some of my favorites snippets, a complete list of snippets can be seen [directly at the code](https://github.com/joseramonc/rails-snippets/tree/master/snippets) or once the package is installed at Settings > Packages > Rails Snippets\n### `=loop`\n\n![=loop_demo](http://cl.ly/image/2z0j2j043W22/=loop.gif)\n\n### `form_for` and `fsf`\n\n![=form_for fsf](http://cl.ly/image/0s3z1t040k16/form_for.gif)\n\n### `scope` + (`p` `l` `bd` `j` `jp`)\n![=form_for fsf](http://cl.ly/image/2U011O3j343r/scopes.gif)\n* `p`roc\n* `l`ambda\n* `bd` Between dates\n* `j`oins\n* `jp`joins & proc\n",
